Pals are persistent LLM-driven helpers designed to help you complete common tasks in interactive data analysis, authoring, and package development. Once created, they can be attached to a keybinding and immediately get to work on repetitive but hard-to-automate tasks.

To create a pal, simply pass `pal()` the ID of a pre-defined pal and a keybinding you'd like it attached to. For example, to use the cli pal:

```r
pal("cli", "Ctrl+Shift+C")
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Much of the documentation in this package is aspirational and its interface is likely to change rapidly.

## Installation

You can install pal like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/pal")
```

Then, ensure that you have an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your [`.env`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv). If you'd like to use an LLM other than Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to power the pal, see `?pal()` to set default metadata on that model. 


## Example

For example, the cli pal created above with `pal("cli", "Ctrl+Shift+C")` provides an RStudio add-in "Convert to cli" registered with the keybinding "Ctrl+Shift+C". After selecting some code, press the keyboard shortcut and wait a moment:

## Available Pals

There are pre-engineered pals for all sorts of tasks in R:

**Interactive Data Analysis**

* ...

**Quarto / Authoring**

* `"label"`: Label code chunks

**Package development**

* `"cli"`: Convert to cli
* `"testthat"`: Convert to testthat 3
* `"roxygen"`: Document functions with roxygen

You can also create your own pals by passing a custom prompt to `pal(role)`.
